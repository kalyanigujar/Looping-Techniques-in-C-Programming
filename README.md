# 🔁 Looping Techniques in C Programming

## 📘 Overview
This repository contains C programs that demonstrate various **looping techniques** used to execute code repeatedly based on a condition.  
Loops are one of the most important control structures in programming — they help reduce redundancy and make programs more efficient.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
The programs in this repository explain and implement the following looping constructs:
- `for` loop  
- `while` loop  
- `do...while` loop  
- Nested loops  
- Use of `break` and `continue` statements  
- Examples of mathematical and pattern-based loops  

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this repository is to help learners:
- Understand how looping structures work in C.  
- Learn the differences between entry-controlled and exit-controlled loops.  
- Practice using loops in real-world programming scenarios (e.g., factorials, tables, patterns).  
- Explore efficient coding practices with repetitive logic.
